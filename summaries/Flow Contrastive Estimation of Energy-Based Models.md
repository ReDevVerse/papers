### General comments on paper quality:
- Well-written and interesting paper.

### Comments:
- Provides a quite interesting comparison of EBMs and flow-based models in the introduction (_"By choosing a flow model, one is making the assumption that the true data distribution is one that is in principle simple to sample from, and is computationally efficient to normalize."_).

- Provides a pretty good introduction to Noise Contrastive Estimation (NCE).

- The proposed method is interesting and intuitively makes sense.

- The experimental results are not overly strong/decisive IMO, but that seems to be true for most papers in this area.
