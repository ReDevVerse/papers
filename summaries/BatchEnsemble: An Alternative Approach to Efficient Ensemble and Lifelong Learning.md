### General comments on paper quality:
- Quite interesting and well-written paper.

### Comments:
- Neat and quite simple idea. I am however not entirely sure how easy it is to implement, it must complicate things somewhat at least?

- Not overly impressed by the calibration/uncertainty experiments, the proposed method is actually quite significantly outperform by standard ensembling. The decrease in test-time computational cost is however impressive.
