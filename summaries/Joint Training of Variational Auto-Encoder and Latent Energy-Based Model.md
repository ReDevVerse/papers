### General comments on paper quality:
- Interesting and very well-written paper.

### Comments:
- Neat and interesting idea.

- The paper is well-written and provides a clear and quite intuitive description of EBMs, VAEs and other related work.

- The comment _"Learning well-formed energy landscape remains a challenging problem, and our experience suggests that the learned energy function can be sensitive to the setting of hyper-parameters and within the training algorithm."_ is somewhat concerning.
