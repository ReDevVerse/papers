### General comments on paper quality:
- Interesting paper.

### Comments:
- Quite a heavy read (section 2 and 3). I didn't really spend enough time reading the paper to fully understand everything.

- The "distance awareness" concept intuitively makes a lot of sense, the example in Figure 1 is impressive, and the results on CIFAR10/100 are also encouraging. 

- I did find section 3.1 quite confusing, Appendix A was definitely useful.
